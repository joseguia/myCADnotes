# myCADnotes
Collections of random CAD notes - tips tricks from the inter-webs-tubes
Lots of information so I wanted a place to house everything accesbile from any device I may happen to be on.

kinda like a blog  - saw a few other devs use this to stash links to resources, so I figured what the heck

if I forget to give credit for something you wrote, drop me a line or comment, I want to be sure everyone gets proper credit, but also - you might have a newer better version of what Im sharing here, win win =)
